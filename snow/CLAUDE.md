# Snow — Project Memory (read this first)

**What it is:** Snow is a new Uganda mobile-money **investment platform**, a sibling
project to **space8** in this same repo. Same category of app (deposits/withdrawals via
mobile money, tiered investment products with daily cashback, 3-level referral
commissions) but a genuinely different brand, product ladder, and visual design —
**not** a reskin of space8, a fresh build that reuses space8's proven backend
architecture/patterns as a starting point.

**Brand inspiration**: the product names are drawn from real **Snow Beer (雪花啤酒)**
variants — the world's best-selling beer brand by volume, from China. 10 reference
photos of the actual bottles are committed at `snow/design/reference-bottles/`
(01–10, matching the product order below) — use these as the visual/mood source of
truth for anything design-related, not assumptions about what "Snow" should look like.

**Status as of this file's creation: planning/design phase.** No backend code has been
written yet. Only the product ladder, rates, nav structure, and 3 rounds of visual
design exploration exist so far (see AGENT_LOG.md for the full design history).

## Repo / branch

- Repo: `loganmore282-debug/x-engine-developments` — same multi-project repo as
  `space8/`, `voltra/`, `choco-mcc/`, `nexus/`. This project's code lives under
  `snow/`, on its own dedicated branch: **`claude/snow-platform-build`**.
- Never edit `space8/`, `voltra/`, or other sibling project folders from Snow sessions.

## Product ladder (confirmed, owner-supplied — 2026-08-26)

10 tiers, flat **150-day cycle**, formula: **Daily Cashback × 150 = Total Return =
Investment × 30**.

| # | Product | Investment | Daily Cashback | Duration | Total Return |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Snow Qing Shuang | UGX 30,000 | UGX 6,000/day | 150 days | UGX 900,000 |
| 2 | Snow Ice Cool (Bing Ku) | UGX 90,000 | UGX 18,000/day | 150 days | UGX 2,700,000 |
| 3 | Snow Brave the World | UGX 197,000 | UGX 39,400/day | 150 days | UGX 5,910,000 |
| 4 | Snow Classic (Old Snow) | UGX 355,000 | UGX 71,000/day | 150 days | UGX 10,650,000 |
| 5 | Snow Draft Beer (Chun Sheng) | UGX 560,000 | UGX 112,000/day | 150 days | UGX 16,800,000 |
| 6 | Snow Brave the World SuperX | UGX 950,000 | UGX 190,000/day | 150 days | UGX 28,500,000 |
| 7 | Snow Marrs Green | UGX 1,000,000 | UGX 200,000/day | 150 days | UGX 30,000,000 |
| 8 | Snow Jiang Xin Ying Zao (Master Artisan) | UGX 1,250,000 | UGX 250,000/day | 150 days | UGX 37,500,000 |
| 9 | Snow Opera Mask Series (Lianpu) | UGX 2,550,000 | UGX 510,000/day | 150 days | UGX 76,500,000 |
| 10 | Snow "Li" (醴) | UGX 4,500,000 | UGX 900,000/day | 150 days | UGX 135,000,000 |

## Platform rates (confirmed, owner-supplied — 2026-08-26)

- Referral commission: **L1 27% / L2 2% / L3 1%**
- Withdrawal fee: **15%**
- Minimum withdrawal: **UGX 8,000**
- Minimum deposit: **UGX 30,000**
- Registration bonus: **UGX 5,000**

Not yet specified by the owner (ask before assuming, or reuse space8's default and flag
it as an assumption): daily check-in bonus amount, referral-count/whole-team-deposit
Task Center ladders, gift code format, withdrawal request hours.

**There is only ONE PIN in Snow, not two** (confirmed, owner-supplied — 2026-08-26):
the 5-digit "Transaction PIN" set at registration (per Codex's auth spec — see Design
status below) IS the same PIN used to authorize withdrawals — there is no separate
"Security PIN"/"Payout PIN" concept the way earlier Nexus/space8-lineage projects had
one. Account's menu tile is labeled "Transaction PIN", not "Security PIN", to keep this
one system consistently named everywhere. When backend work starts: do not build two
separate PIN fields/hashes — one `transactionPin` (or equivalent) gates both first-time
setup and every withdrawal, matching what the registration screen already collects.

## Navigation / IA (confirmed, owner-supplied — 2026-08-26)

**4 tabs: Home, My Products, Team, Account.**

- **Home** — has an admin-configurable banner, **no activity/live ticker** (explicitly
  excluded, unlike space8 which has one), and **the full product catalog lives directly
  on Home** (not a separate "Products" tab like space8).
- **My Products** — the member's own active investments/plans (progress, next payout).
  Separate tab from Home's browse-and-buy catalog.
- **Team** — referral levels (L1/L2/L3), referral code/link, commission structure.
- **Account** — profile identity, wallet/menu tiles (withdrawal account, deposit/
  withdrawal history, security PIN, etc.), standard settings menu rows.

**Notifications feature removed (owner decision, 2026-08-26).** No bell/notifications
screen anywhere in Snow. Home's hero header had its bell stripped the same day and now
uses the same bespoke bell-less header as Account/Team (snowflake + `BOTTLE_BADGE` +
"SNOW" wordmark, white text since it's on the dark hero background). Known stale
residue: My Products' `top_bar()` header still renders a bell icon (leftover from the
round-4/5 spec) — owner explicitly said leave My Products as-is for now, so this is
NOT fixed yet. Strip the bell (and don't call `top_bar()` with a bell at all —
Account/Team/Home's bell-less bespoke header is the correct pattern) when My Products
finally goes through its own Codex critique round.

## Design status — settled on a Codex-authored system as of 2026-08-26, now mid-build

**Round 5 is the current, live design direction — read this section (and the round-5
AGENT_LOG.md entry, which lists all 7 fixes in detail) before touching visual design
again.** Round 4 established the token/component system below (still accurate, unchanged
in round 5). Round 5 applied Codex's critique of round 4's screenshots: one canonical
wave curve (used only on Home; Team/Account use a wave-less `brand-card` variant with
just the corner lines), a dedicated `--snow-wave-on-wine` token so the green corner
lines don't blend muddy-brown against the wine background, the full 10-product
catalogue with real bottle-photo thumbnails per tier (was hardcoded to 5), a fixed
cross-screen financial mismatch (Home's Total Invested/Earned now agree with My
Products' plan cards), and a fuller token/component set (`--snow-wine-soft`/
`green-soft`/`neutral-soft`, `--snow-radius-*`, `product-card`/`plan-card`/
`stat-tile`/`icon-tile`/`segmented-control`/`settings-list`/`list-row`/`top-bar`).
Rounds 1–3 (ice/blue, amber/gold beer-pour, dark wood-grain — all Claude-only
explorations) are superseded and should NOT be revisited; they're kept in
AGENT_LOG.md purely as history of what was already tried and rejected.

**The owner had Codex design the login/register screens directly** (screenshots
relayed back into chat, same review-prompt workflow already established on space8) and
Codex also produced a full written design-system spec at the same time. Both are now
the source of truth:

- **Visual reference screens** (Codex-designed, pixel-final, not to be altered without
  the owner asking): `snow/design/mockups/00-register.png`,
  `snow/design/mockups/00-login.png`.
- **Design tokens** (white/black/wine-red/green — **no blue, no amber/gold, no dark
  wood theme** — all three of rounds 1–3 are explicitly ruled out by this spec):
  ```css
  --snow-canvas: #FCFBF9;   /* main page background */
  --snow-surface: #FFFFFF;  /* cards, fields, sheets */
  --snow-ink: #111111;      /* headings and primary text */
  --snow-muted: #737373;    /* secondary text */
  --snow-wine: #941827;     /* primary CTA, hero, active state */
  --snow-wine-deep: #71101B;/* subtle hero depth only */
  --snow-green: #2F6B47;    /* waves, success, links, verified state */
  --snow-border: #E8E4E1;   /* field/card outline */
  ```
- **Radii**: main cards 28px, input cards 26px, primary buttons 24px, sheets/modals
  32px 32px 0 0. Soft clean shadows, thin warm-gray borders, not harsh box-shadows.
- **Brand language**: green snowflake mark + wordmark "SNOW"; wine-red hero areas with
  a large smooth white wave curving into the form/content area below, plus thin
  bottle-green parallel wave-line decorations in the hero's corners. Built with
  SVG/CSS shapes, not a screenshot background.
- **Component vocabulary Codex asked for** (build all future screens out of these, not
  one-off markup): `brand-hero`, `brand-wave`, `wave-lines`, `app-card`, `form-field`,
  `primary-button`, `secondary-button`, `status-pill`, `bottom-nav`, `bottom-sheet`.
- **Explicit product-behavior constraints from the same spec** (relevant once backend
  work starts, not just visual): registration fields are exactly Mobile number /
  Password / Transaction PIN (5 digits) — no confirmation fields, no referral/checkbox/
  social login unless the owner asks later; only show "Forgot password?" once a real
  reset flow exists; never log/store/expose a raw password or PIN in client state;
  money movement must stay server-side/idempotent with a ledger record per
  balance-changing event; frontend state is display-only.

**Claude then built Home, My Products, Team, and Account against this exact spec**
(not a redesign — a direct application of the tokens/components above), rendered as
static PNG screenshots via Playwright rather than an interactive Claude Artifact link,
per the owner's explicit ask (*"can you send me photos instead of artifacts of html"*)
so they're easy to hand to Codex directly:
`snow/design/mockups/01-home.png`, `02-my-products.png`, `03-team.png`,
`04-account.png`. Editable source for these 4 (plain standalone HTML, not the
design-canvas `.dc.html` format used in rounds 1–3) is at
`snow/design/mockup-src/*.html` + the Python generator `build.py` that produced them
(`python3 build.py` regenerates the HTML from the shared token/component definitions
inside it; screenshot with Playwright + `chromium` at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`,
390px width, `device_scale_factor=2`, `full_page=True`).

**Known limitation, disclosed to the owner**: the wave curvature and corner-line
decoration on Home/Team/Account's hero cards are Claude's own approximation of the
brand language Codex described in prose — Codex's actual SVG source for the
login/register hero was never shared, only the rendered screenshots, so the curve
shape is not pixel-identical between the two auth screens and these 4. If Codex's
critique flags the wave shape specifically, that's expected and worth fixing with
real coordinates from Codex rather than guessed ones.

**Status: Account has its own locked structure as of round 7/8 — a coloured card
matrix (feature cards + utility cards + Sign out), not a list.** Read the round-7/8
AGENT_LOG.md entries before touching Account again: they cover the exact
`.account-grid`/`.account-feature-card`/`.account-utility-card` CSS, why Records now
replaces separate Deposit/Withdrawal History tiles, why Transaction PIN has no card
here anymore, and how the real Snow Beer bottle photos got their backgrounds removed
(`rembg`, confirmed working offline in this environment — see that entry before
assuming background removal isn't possible here).

**Team was rebuilt in round 9 (2026-08-26) to match Account's card language** — a
wine-gradient `.team-referral-card` (referral code + copy bubble + invite-link pill +
share button), a 3-panel commission strip, a `.team-summary-grid` (total team/active
referrals tiles + a green `.team-deposits-card`), a pill-track `.team-level-switcher`,
and a member-list `app-card` with alternating wine/green avatar bubbles and
`+256 700 *** 123`-style masked phone numbers. Read the round-9 AGENT_LOG.md entry
before touching Team again — it also documents (and fixes) a `BOTTLE_BADGE` variable
ordering bug in `build.py` worth knowing about if `NameError` ever resurfaces there.
Team's header now shares the same bell-less bottle-badge layout as Account's, so
`top_bar()` is no longer called from Team's section.

Home and My Products are still governed by the round-4/5/6 spec described above
(Codex's original tokens/wave/component system) and have NOT yet been through their
own dedicated Codex critique round — only the shared bottom-nav icon/active-state
update and product-image-on-left fix have landed there. Do not treat Home or My
Products as final until they go through the same critique-and-rebuild pass Account
and Team already have.

## Build/backend — REAL APP BUILT as of 2026-08-26, ready for first deploy

**Owner override, same day**: after the "finish designing every screen first" sequencing
decision (below, kept for history) was recorded, the owner said "now ready to go" and
asked to build the real backend + frontend + admin immediately and deploy to Render, on
the current designs — explicitly accepting that Home/My Products haven't had their own
Codex critique round yet (only Account and Team have). This is the live decision; do not
revert to "finish designing first" without the owner saying so again.

**What exists now, real and working (not mockups):**
- `snow/server.js` + `snow/db.js` — Express/MongoDB backend, adapted from space8's
  proven money-safety patterns (claim-before-credit, `withLock` per-key mutexes,
  STATUS-BEFORE-REFUND, cumulative-target daily-cashback math, first-purchase-only
  referral commission) but re-scoped to Snow: Snow's own rates/product ladder, a single
  Transaction PIN set at registration (no auto-setup-on-first-use, no separate payout
  PIN), mobile-money-only withdrawal accounts (no bank transfer), no gift codes, no
  notifications, no check-in, no assistant chat, no multi-admin accounts — just one
  `ADMIN_KEY`. Verified: syntax-checked, boots cleanly against dummy Firebase creds
  (fails only at the expected Mongo-connect step with no live DB), and the full 10-tier
  product ladder's cumulative-payout math was verified in isolation to telescope to
  exactly `price × 30` over 150 days for every tier with zero rounding drift.
- `snow/user-src/index.html` (+ deployed copy `snow/user/index.html`, product images at
  `snow/user/bottles/`) — the real single-page app. Login/Register screens rebuilt to
  match Codex's locked `00-login.png`/`00-register.png` pixel-for-pixel in structure
  (verified via a static Playwright render); Home/My Products/Team/Account carry the
  exact markup + `--snow-*` CSS tokens/components from `build.py` straight into the real
  app, wired to live data instead of hardcoded mockup numbers. Firebase modular SDK
  (v10, gstatic CDN) for auth; a plain `api()` fetch helper attaches the ID token.
  Verified end-to-end with a mocked-backend Playwright harness (all 4 main pages +
  Deposit/Withdraw/Withdrawal-Accounts/Invest-confirm/Info sheets + the Register tab) —
  found and fixed one real bug this way (Account's bottom-nav icon looked up a
  nonexistent `ICONS.account` key and rendered "undefined").
- `snow/admin-src/index.html` (+ deployed copy `snow/admin/index.html`) — new MVP admin
  panel (Snow never had a prior admin to reskin, unlike space8's ChocoMCC-derived one):
  single-admin-key login, Dashboard stats, Users (search, credit/debit, ban/unban),
  Deposits (force-credit), Withdrawals (send/reject), Products (edit price/cycle/return/
  active/comingSoon), Settings (rates, maintenance, About/Rules/support text, home
  banner upload). Verified with the same mocked-backend Playwright approach — all 6 tabs
  render correctly and read live values with no console errors.
- `snow/render.yaml` + `snow/package.json` — mirrors space8's proven 3-service Render
  layout (`snow-server` web service, `snow-app`/`snow-admin` static sites with SPA
  rewrite rules and clickjacking-hardening headers). Validated as syntactically correct
  YAML/JSON with the right service names and `rootDir`s.

**Deliberately deferred, not attempted this round** (flag to the owner, don't silently
build later without asking): PWA manifest/service-worker/install-prompt, obfuscated
build pipeline (space8's `build-core.js`/`guard-src.js` — Snow ships `user-src/`
straight to `user/` unobfuscated for now), live countdown timers on My Products'
progress cards, skeleton loaders (plain "Loading…" text stands in), push notifications,
multi-admin staff accounts (one shared `ADMIN_KEY` only), and the full ChatGPT/Codex
security-audit rounds space8 went through (~20+ rounds) — the money-safety logic itself
was ported from that already-hardened codebase, but this specific Snow copy of it has
not yet been independently re-audited.

**Before this can go live**: the owner needs to (1) finish the MongoDB Atlas database
user setup (pick a Built-in Role, click Add User — see Live infra below), (2) set
`MONGODB_URI`/`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`/`ADMIN_KEY`/`MARZPAY_KEY` as env vars on the
`snow-server` Render service (never commit these), (3) update `API_BASE` in both
`user-src/index.html` and `admin-src/index.html` once the real `snow-server` Render URL
is known (currently a placeholder `https://snow-server.onrender.com`), (4) create the 3
Render services from `render.yaml` (or match it manually), (5) do a real end-to-end
device test — nothing here has been exercised against a live Firebase project, live
MongoDB, or live MarzPay yet, only smoke-tested with mocked responses.

**Design-sequencing decision, superseded but kept for context**: earlier the same day,
the plan was to finish locking every screen's design (via the generator+screenshot+
Codex-critique loop) before converting anything to a real app, specifically to avoid
rebuilding already-converted screens every time a later critique reveals a shared-
component change (exactly what happened across Account rounds 6→7→8). The owner's
"build it now" override above replaces this — Home/My Products can still go through
their own Codex critique rounds later, applied directly to the now-real
`user-src/index.html` instead of `build.py`'s mockup generator.

## Live infra (provisioning started 2026-08-26)

- **Firebase**: project `snow-beer-cbf65`. Client-side web config (safe to commit —
  a Firebase web `apiKey` is not a secret, access control is Security Rules/App Check,
  same reasoning space8 already uses for its own committed config in
  `user-src/index.html`/`admin-src/index.html`):
  ```js
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyDhaVbSaQyYRdSiP1LLze-Apb6kNNTVCsc",
    authDomain: "snow-beer-cbf65.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "snow-beer-cbf65",
    storageBucket: "snow-beer-cbf65.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "171510439127",
    appId: "1:171510439127:web:94f15dd79aa057e3d32492",
    measurementId: "G-4S4ZES85SS"
  };
  ```
  Nothing consumes this yet — no frontend code exists under `snow/` beyond the design
  mockups. When the real user-facing app is built, this goes into its Firebase
  init script the same way space8's does. The Firebase **service-account JSON**
  (server-side, genuinely secret) has NOT been provided and must never go in this repo
  when it is — only into the backend host's env vars, exactly like space8's
  `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` on Render.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: owner is creating a dedicated `snow` database user (same shared
  cluster/project space8 and choco-mcc already use, separated by database name — see
  space8's own equivalent note in `space8/CLAUDE.md`). Mid-setup as of 2026-08-26: the
  Atlas "Add New Database User" dialog was screenshotted with username `snow` filled
  in but **no role selected yet** — Atlas requires at least one Built-in Role or
  Specific Privilege before "Add User" actually saves. Next step: pick a role (e.g.
  `readWriteAnyDatabase`, matching the existing `chocomcc` user's own role in that
  project, or a tighter `readWrite` scoped to just the `snow` database) and click Add
  User. **The generated password was never recorded in this repo** — the resulting
  full `MONGODB_URI` connection string is a secret and must go straight into whatever
  hosting platform's env vars end up running Snow's backend, never into a commit, and
  ideally never pasted into chat again either.

## Secrets — NEVER commit

MongoDB URI and the Firebase service-account JSON are the two real secrets Snow will
need once backend work starts — both live ONLY in the hosting platform's env vars,
never in this repo. The Firebase web client config above is the one exception
(genuinely not secret) — don't confuse the two when handling future infra messages.
