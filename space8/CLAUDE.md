# Space8 — Project Memory (read this first)

**Read this whole file before doing anything.** This project went through several wrong
turns across two sessions before landing on the real plan. This file exists so the next
session doesn't repeat those mistakes. The owner's own words, when quoted below, are the
actual source of truth — don't re-interpret them differently than how they're recorded
here.

## What this project actually is

A Uganda mobile-money **investment platform** (VIP-tier "satellite plan" investments,
3-level referral commissions, MarzPay deposits/withdrawals). Built on **ChocoMCC's**
proven backend/admin, reskinned and rebranded — see the three-part split below for exactly
what was reused vs. rebuilt.

**The rename to "space8" is DONE.** Folder is `space8/` (not `novera/`), every brand
string/identifier is renamed (`NOVA_*`→`SPACE8_*`, `Novera`→`Space8`, `novera`→`space8` —
storage-key prefixes, synthetic email domain, Mongo dbName fallback, cache names,
`package.json`, `render.yaml` service names). The owner confirmed explicitly: **full
replace everywhere**, nothing stays "Novera" internally. Do not re-ask this question.

## The three-part split — this is the most important thing to get right

The owner was explicit and this must not be re-litigated without them saying so:

1. **Backend (`server.js`, `db.js`, all `test-*.js`, `build-core.js`, `build-admin.js`,
   `guard-src.js`, `render.yaml`, `package.json`) — KEEP AS-IS.** ChocoMCC's proven,
   tested business logic (referral commissions, MarzPay integration, money-safety locking
   on an ACID-less MongoDB M0 tier, the 60-file test suite). Only ever touched for
   brand-string renames or genuinely new endpoints (e.g. a future "Show" feature) — never
   rewritten.
2. **Admin panel (`admin-src/index.html`, `admin/`) — a ChocoMCC reskin, correct as an
   approach.** The owner's original instruction — *"l told you everything admin we just
   replace, see ChocoMCC admin, we just replace just name and logo, everything remains
   every feature, every code"* — means don't redesign it from scratch. Later in the same
   session the owner also said to remove USD/USDT depositing and, after clarifying, bank-
   transfer *withdrawal* too (not `/bank/save`, which despite its name binds a
   MOBILE-MONEY payout account and is required for every withdrawal — that stays).
   **Both removals are DONE.** USDT deposit was fully deleted (self-contained feature, no
   shared logic with mobile money). Bank-transfer withdrawal was handled differently:
   `/withdraw/request` now hard-locks to `method:'mobile_money'` so a new bank-transfer
   withdrawal can never be created, but the `isBank` branches inside the shared
   processing/reconciler functions were deliberately left in place (harmless dead code,
   safer than surgically deleting logic shared with mobile-money withdrawals). See
   `AGENT_LOG.md` for the full breakdown of what was removed vs. deliberately kept.
3. **User-facing app (`user-src/index.html` + `user-src/original_module.js`, and its built
   artifact `user/`) — REBUILT FROM SCRATCH, this is done as of the most recent session.**
   Zero lines of ChocoMCC's original frontend structure remain — the owner rejected an
   earlier draft hard for looking like a recolored respray (*"we are building space8, you
   are just respraying choco... make space8 on its own, different design, architecture"*).
   The current build is a genuinely new frontend against the approved design system (see
   below), calling the *same* backend endpoints (that part never changes). **What's NOT
   verified yet: a real end-to-end pass on a live device/browser** — the sandbox this was
   built in can't reach `gstatic.com`/`onrender.com` (egress policy), so real Firebase
   auth + real API calls were never exercised live, only smoke-tested with a mocked API
   layer. Do this real check before trusting any specific screen fully works.

## Design system (approved, now built against)

Static mockup, still in the repo: **`space8/design/visual-system-mockup.html`**. The real
app in `user-src/` was built directly against this.

- **Palette — white/ink + one DOMINANT accent color, nothing else.** As of 2026-08-16 the
  accent is **green** (an emerald, `--blue: #0e8a5c`) — changed from blue per the owner:
  "change to green... the color is dull" (asked to choose between "make blue shine" or a
  full switch; confirmed explicitly: "Switch to green"). **The CSS custom properties kept
  their `--blue*` names on purpose** (`--blue`, `--blue-dim: #0a6b47`, `--blue-mute:
  #5fa187`, `--blue-glow: rgba(14,138,92,.20)`, `--surface-blue: #e7f6ef`) — a full
  rename across every `var(--blue...)` reference in `user-src/index.html` was judged
  higher-risk (easy to miss an occurrence) than just swapping the values, which is exactly
  how blue itself already changed shade once earlier the same session (`#2e6bff` →
  `#0f52ba` → now green). Don't be misled by the name when reading the CSS — check the
  actual hex. Applied broadly on purpose: nearly every SVG icon (topbar, nav — active AND
  inactive, form fields, ticker, account matrix, menu rows + chevrons), `.btn-secondary`/
  `.btn-ghost` outlines, assistant quick-reply chips, `.section-title` headers, pale-tinted
  stat cards (`.mystats .card`, `.mtile`, new `--surface-blue` token), and subtle card
  linings (`.balance-card`, `.prod-card`, `.plan-card`). The two deliberate exceptions are
  `.action-btn.done`/`.milestone-card.done` (kept gray — a semantic "already claimed"
  muted state, not leftover neutral). A single desaturated red (`--danger`) is the only
  non-accent color, reserved for genuine failure states. No violet, no gold, no gradients
  anywhere (the auth screens and sheets are flat, no hero image/gradient — see below).
  If the accent color changes again, prefer the same value-only-swap approach unless a
  future session has a strong reason to do the full rename.
- **Typography**: a single self-hosted Inter variable font (weights 400–800, base64
  `@font-face`, changed 2026-08-16 from an earlier two-font Instrument Sans + Space Mono
  system per the owner). `.mono` only sets `font-variant-numeric:tabular-nums` now, no
  separate font-family.
- **Light theme ONLY, forced** — the owner was explicit ("I don't need dark mode, I need
  light white mode"). The `prefers-color-scheme:dark` media block and `[data-theme="dark"]`
  overrides that used to exist have been deleted entirely; do not re-add device-driven dark
  mode without being asked again.
- **No slide/bottom-sheet animation** — bottom sheets (`.sheet-bg`/`.sheet`) open as
  centered, instantly-appearing modals (`align-items:center`, no transform/transition at
  all), changed 2026-08-16 from an earlier slide-up-from-bottom pattern per the owner
  ("sheets should not slide from down, rather should open from middle" + a general "stop
  bringing animation" complaint). The one deliberate exception is the horizontal activity
  ticker on Home, a continuous CSS-keyframe marquee — the owner asked for this "running
  checker" by name, it is not the animation they meant to stop.
- **No decorative card borders** ("no frames") — `.card`/`.prod-card`/`.plan-card`/etc.
  rely on `background:var(--surface)` against `var(--page-bg)` for grouping, not an outline.
  Functional element borders (form `.field`/`.auth-input`, `.btn-secondary`/`.btn-ghost`
  outlines) are kept — those aren't decorative, they're the interactive boundary.
- Visual identity via precision, not decoration: SVG progress ring on active-plan cards,
  tabular monospaced money, skeleton loaders (not spinners) on every async section.

## Nav / IA (as built)

**4 tabs: Home, Products, Team, Account.** The owner's original description (earlier
session) mentioned a 5th tab, "Show," but the most recent explicit dictation this session
only listed these 4 and never mentioned Show again — treated as dropped-for-now, not
resolved either way. Confirm with the owner before adding or permanently ruling out a 5th
tab.

- **Home** — account balance / cumulative earnings / total invested, admin-set banner
  (`barstack` slot), Deposit/Withdraw/Check-in action buttons, a live activity ticker (off
  the pre-existing `/public/activity-feed` endpoint — this was already built server-side,
  don't rebuild it), active-plan cards with a progress ring, a 10-of-15 products preview
  scrolling to the full catalog.
- **Products** — shortcuts row, admin banner (`darkbar`), My Products + cumulative
  earnings summary, full product cards (name/price/cycle/daily income/total return/
  Invest), invest confirmation sheet.
- **Team** — admin banner (`giftbox`), Level 1/2/3 tabs at 28%/2%/1% (off
  `/team/members?level=`), Task Center milestones (off `/team/stats` +
  `/team/milestone/claim` — already existed server-side).
- **Account** — admin banner (`rocherstack`), profile + referral share, 4-tile matrix
  (payout account / deposits / withdrawals / security PIN), About/Rules/Terms/Privacy/
  Support sheets sourced from `/public/settings`, logout.
- **"Show"** — still does not exist anywhere, frontend or backend. The owner's original
  description: users upload a screenshot of their withdrawal/payment and are granted a
  reward — a proof-of-payment social feature, genuinely new (upload flow, storage, admin
  review/approval queue, reward-grant mechanism). Needs full scoping if/when confirmed
  still wanted.
- **Floating assistant** — bottom-right bubble, full-screen chat panel, backed by a real
  server endpoint: `POST /assistant/chat` in `server.js`. **Self-hosted, no external
  API, no per-message cost** — the owner explicitly does not want to pay for an LLM key
  ("I don't have a Claude API key, I am not willing to buy it"). The actual logic lives
  in `assistant-engine.js`: stems/tokenizes the message, scores it against ~16 weighted
  intents, fuzzy-matches specific product names from the live catalog, extracts a money
  amount from the message to compute real withdrawal-fee math on the spot, and blends in
  the prior turn's topic for short ambiguous follow-ups. Every reply is grounded in a
  fresh `getSettings()`/`getProducts()`/account read, same as the client used to do
  manually — so it never goes stale as the admin changes fees/rates/products. Refuses to
  reveal a PIN/password if asked. Rate-limited (`assistLimiter`, 30/min/user) to bound DB-
  read spam, not API spend. No env var needed, nothing left to configure.

## Product ladder — real, LIVE as of 2026-08-16 (was a chocolate-derived placeholder)

The owner's PDF (`Space8_Investment_Plans_and_Variables.pdf` — it's sitting in this
environment's upload directory under `/root/.claude/uploads/`, not committed to the repo;
re-find it there rather than asking the owner to resend it if a future session needs the
source) has the real 15-plan catalog, and **`DEFAULT_PRODUCTS` in `server.js` now IS this
real catalog** — Sputnik 1 (15,000) through James Webb Space Telescope (20,000,000), every
tier x42 return over a fixed 210-day cycle, daily cashback = 20% of price/day =
`expectedReturn / cycle`. This is still just the *boot fallback* — the admin panel's
`products` collection remains the real source of truth and overrides any of these the
moment the owner saves something there via `getProducts()`'s merge — but a fresh
install (or an install where nothing has been admin-saved yet, which was the actual state
that caused the "products very different from ours" complaint this fixed) now shows the
real catalog by default instead of leftover ChocoMCC placeholder data.

`DEFAULT_SETTINGS` also now matches the PDF's platform-variables table: min deposit
20,000 · min withdrawal 5,000 · withdrawal fee 15% · registration bonus 5,000 · referral L1
28% / L2 2% / L3 1% (31% total) · duration 210 days · return x42. Still verify against live
Settings in the admin panel before assuming these are what's actually configured — the
admin panel always wins if the owner has touched it.

**Referral commission is deliberately first-purchase-only, confirmed intentional —
don't re-flag this as a bug.** L1/L2/L3 commission pays exactly once, off a member's
first-ever investment (`isFirstInvestment` on the investment doc), never on later
purchases/recharges by that same member. A second review (Codex, 2026-08-16) asked
whether this matches intended rules — yes, this was a deliberate design decision made
earlier in the project, not an oversight. Later purchases still count toward Task
Center milestones (active-referral-count, L1-deposit-total), they just never re-trigger
L1/L2/L3 commission.

## Repo / branch / infra

- Repo: `loganmore282-debug/x-engine-developments` — a multi-project repo; this project's
  code lives under `space8/`, sibling to `voltra/`, `choco-mcc/`, `nexus/`, and others.
  **Never edit `choco-mcc/` or `voltra/` from this project's sessions.**
- Branch: `claude/space8-rename-frontend-rebuild-juurd7`.
- `space8/CODEX.md` points Codex sessions at this file — the owner wants **Codex and
  ChatGPT working alongside Claude**, all three reading/writing the same two files rather
  than each re-deriving context from scratch. `space8/AGENT_LOG.md` is the shared
  changelog — **append an entry after every fix**, however small, regardless of which
  agent you are. Read `CLAUDE.md` (this file) first, then `AGENT_LOG.md` in full, before
  starting new work — the log has the granular history this file summarizes. Any agent
  pointed at this repo needs to be told explicitly which branch to read
  (`claude/space8-rename-frontend-rebuild-juurd7` as of this writing) — GitHub tools
  default to the repo's default branch, which does not have this project's work on it.
- **Live infra, all real and deployed**:
  - MongoDB Atlas: dedicated `space8_db_user` on the shared "Cluster0" (also hosts
    chocomcc/temubrazil data — separated by database name, `/space8`).
  - Firebase: a **new** project `space8-9d97c` (the owner deliberately created this fresh
    rather than reusing the earlier "novera" project) — client config is in both
    `admin-src/index.html` and `user-src/index.html`; service-account JSON is
    `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` on Render; Cloud Messaging VAPID key updated in
    `admin-src/index.html` (the old one belonged to "novera" and would have silently
    failed against the new project).
  - Render: 3 services — static site `space8-app` at `https://space8-app.onrender.com`
    (rootDir `space8/user`); a static site for admin at a **deliberately obscured URL**
    the owner chose on purpose (not `space8-admin`) to reduce casual discovery of a
    money-moving login — do not "fix" this to something more discoverable; a web service
    backend also at a deliberately obscured URL (hardcoded in code as
    `mycallbackurl.onrender.com` — this is intentional, not a placeholder needing a
    rename).
  - `ADMIN_KEY`/`MARZPAY_KEY` set on the backend service.

## Where the code lives

- `user-src/index.html` + `user-src/original_module.js` — the real, rebuilt frontend.
  **Readable, edit here.** No embedded product-photo blobs anymore (`SPACE8_IMAGES`/
  `SPACE8_BANNERS` were removed — images now come from each product's own `image` field
  and from `/public/banners`), so `build-core.js` will print a harmless warning about not
  finding those constants — that's expected, not a bug.
- `user/` — built artifact (`build-core.js` output). Never hand-edit; ~434KB now (was
  ~2.17MB before the frontend rebuild dropped the old embedded photos).
- `admin-src/index.html` — readable admin source, a straight ChocoMCC reskin with USDT
  deposit and bank-transfer withdrawal now removed (see three-part split above).
- `admin/` — built admin artifact (`build-admin.js` output). Never hand-edit.
- `server.js` — Express backend. Keep as the foundation; only add new endpoints for
  genuinely new features (Show, the server-side assistant).
- `db.js` — Mongo↔Firestore compat layer. **M0 free tier = no ACID transactions** —
  money-crediting paths use in-process Sets as single-writer locks. Do not remove these.
- `test-*.js` (54 files, all passing as of the rename) — run before/after any backend
  change: `for f in test-*.js; do node "$f"; done` (no `npm test` wired up).
- `build-core.js` / `build-admin.js` / `guard-src.js` — obfuscation/build pipeline, prints
  "round-trip OK" when valid. Always rebuild after editing `*-src/`. `guard-src.js` has a
  hardcoded domain allowlist (`space8.com`, `www.space8.com`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`,
  any `*.onrender.com`) — a cloned/rehosted copy on any other domain wipes itself. Update
  this list if the real custom domain changes from `space8.com`.
- `render.yaml` — Render deploy config (rootDir `space8`, `space8/user`, `space8/admin`).
  Not actually what the owner used to set up the 3 live services (they did it manually
  through the Render UI, matching this file's settings) — keep it in sync anyway as the
  source of truth for what the manual setup should match.
- `design/visual-system-mockup.html` — the approved design direction, now built against.

## Known gaps / deferred — do not claim any of these are done

See `AGENT_LOG.md`'s most recent entry for the full detail. Short version:

1. **Real end-to-end device/browser check** — register, log in, deposit, invest,
   withdraw, referral, check-in, and now the assistant + registration-time PIN —
   none of this has been verified against the live Firebase project + live
   backend in a real browser yet.
2. **"Show" feature** — not scoped, not built, anywhere.
3. **Server-side floating assistant — DONE, nothing pending.** `POST /assistant/chat`
   is fully self-hosted (`assistant-engine.js`, no external API/key/cost — the owner
   declined to buy a Claude API key, so don't suggest wiring one back in), wired up
   end-to-end in `user-src/original_module.js` (typing indicator, rolling history).
4. **Real product catalog — DONE as of 2026-08-16, code-level.** `DEFAULT_PRODUCTS`/
   `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` in `server.js` now hold the real 15-tier catalog from the owner's
   PDF (see "Product ladder" section above). The owner may still want to also enter/
   review it via the admin panel for full control going forward — that admin-panel step
   was never actually required for the numbers to be correct, just for the owner to be
   able to edit them without a code change.
5. **VAPID key** — updated in code, not test-fired against a real device yet.
6. **ChatGPT + Codex security-review findings — DONE as of 2026-08-16.** The
   referral-commission double-pay-on-crash race and the withdrawal-bookkeeping
   `Promise.all` race (originally flagged by ChatGPT, independently re-flagged by
   Codex, both verified real by re-reading the actual code before touching anything)
   are fixed — `creditReferralCommission` now claims each level before crediting it
   (same pattern `/redeem` already used), `processWithdrawalCore` writes sequentially
   with the `totalWithdrawn` stat wrapped so a failure there can't throw past a
   payout that already succeeded. Codex also caught two NEW real bugs in the same
   pass: `completeRegistrationCore` could inflate a referrer's team counts on a
   crash-retry (fixed by moving those increments to after `registrationDone` is set),
   and the check-in streak's ledger read used `.limit(500)` with no `orderBy`, which
   on Mongo returns oldest-first natural order — silently corrupting the streak for
   any account with >500 lifetime check-ins (fixed with `orderBy('createdAt','desc')`).
   `/assistant/chat` was also missing the ban check every other endpoint has — added.
   All verified by a new `test-codex-review-fixes.js` (14/14) plus the full existing
   suite. Two other Codex findings were checked and do NOT apply here: the
   "`/team/members` Firestore `'in'`-limit" claim doesn't hold since this project runs
   on MongoDB (via a Firestore-shaped compat layer) whose `$in` has no such small cap;
   and "revert `--blue` to `#2e6bff`" directly contradicts the owner's own explicit
   instruction earlier the same session to move away from that exact color — the
   *design* critique behind it (cards read as white-with-blue-accents, not genuinely
   blue-dominant) was valid and acted on using the current blue family instead (see
   `AGENT_LOG.md`).

## Secrets — NEVER commit

`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, `MONGODB_URI`, `ADMIN_KEY`, `MARZPAY_KEY` live only in Render
env vars. Never commit secrets or model identifiers. (Note: this session's chat log does
contain some of these in plaintext, at the owner's own insistence after being warned —
that's a chat-log exposure, not a repo one; nothing above is committed to git.)
